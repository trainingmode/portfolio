        <strong>Dataing</strong> is an AI matchmaking service, with a focus on
        dating. Connect your social media to let <em>Cupid AI</em>
        <strong>analyze your social media</strong> and
        <strong>match you</strong> with people you’ll find interesting.
      </p>
      <p>I <strong>cofounded the company</strong> with CEO Mark Kilaghbian.</p>
      <p>
        I both <strong>designed</strong> &amp; <strong>developed</strong> the
        initial <strong>webapp MVP</strong>; developed our
        <strong>v1 backend dashboard</strong>; developed our
        <strong>design system</strong>; developed the
        <strong>Waitlist webapp</strong>; spearheaded
        <strong>mobile design</strong> &amp;
        <strong>frontend development</strong>; and <strong>hired</strong>,
        <strong>trained</strong>, &amp; <strong>led</strong> intern designers
        &amp; engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I
        <strong
          >organized &amp; coordinated our team during the early stages of the
          company</strong
        >
        and
        <strong
          >led the design team through the development of the iOS app</strong
        >. Using classic <strong>Agile practices</strong> and armed with a
        4-tier Jira board (<strong>To Do</strong>, <strong>In Progress</strong>,
        <strong>QA</strong>, <strong>Done</strong>), I coordinated the
        engineering team’s work and directed the design team’s work. I also
        coordinated with the marketing team to ensure brand consistency across
        socials.
      </p>
      <p>
        I <strong>developed a Figma plugin</strong> for exporting designs as
        SwiftUI code—w<em>ithout AI translation</em>. A
        <strong>custom parser</strong> was built specifically for our design
        system. Much of the core SwiftUI standard is implemented. Designs are
        fully pixel &amp; layout accurate from Figma -&gt; SwiftUI.
      </p>
      <p>
        During 2024, I side-hustled upwards of 40-80 hours/week to afford to
        work on this project. This takes a toll on creative energy &amp; eats
        into creative time. I feel this project represents my perseverance and
        ability to stick through tough situations while performing my leadership
        &amp; creative duties accordingly.

      <p>
        My goal as a leader is to elevate my team, smartly delegate according to
        core competencies, provide immediate support, and remove friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I develop &amp; implement systems so my team has a collective
        understanding of their individual responsibilities against our overall
        objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My purpose is to maximize human capital efficiency &amp; maintain
        quality output.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a human level, I want to make sure everyone on my team feels seen,
        and truly valued for their work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Owned our Figma</strong>. Organization was crucial. I
            created systems for organizing components, tokens, and other design
            assets. Made marketing, UI assets exportable and easibly accessible
            org-wide. Categorized assets into separate libraries, design files,
            and folders for a more intuitive, organized experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Owned our Notion</strong>, our knowledgebase hub. It
            contained onboarding for design &amp; marketing; guides (setup,
            maintenance) for various platforms (<em>Figma</em>, <em>OpenAI</em>,
            <em>Azure</em>, <em>Google Cloud</em>); and other resources. All
            <strong>fully-formatted</strong>, <strong>organized</strong>, &amp;
            <strong>beautiful</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong><em>100% intern retention rate on $0 budget</em></strong
            >. All <code>7</code> design interns (UI &amp; marketing, 1
            frontend) completed their full 6-month term, with several choosing
            to extend their internship. Intern attendance and alma-maters
            include USC, Dartmouth, NYU, &amp; UCLA.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Delegated tasks &amp; ownership of key features. I believe fostering
            an environment of trust builds confidence amongst team members.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I <strong>made myself available 24/7</strong>–<strong
              >including weekends</strong
            >–to answer questions and support interns on their duties.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I champion a culture of <em>accountability</em>,
            <em>self-improvement</em>, and <em>innovative-thinking</em> with
            <strong>hands-on mentorship</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Provided cross-discipline growth sessions</strong> that I
            tailored to individual intern paths. I enjoyed translating my skills
            &amp; knowledge in a way that complemented an interns current
            abilities. I wanted them to stay challenged &amp; confident, while
            continuing to grow during their time with us.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Developed case studies</strong> for interns: physical
            properties of light &amp; glass; gradient composition/blending &amp;
            color spaces; character design basics; Figma advanced techniques
            &amp; social content composition; “design-a-thon” weekend challenge
            to research an app’s major feature (aka TikTok’s scrolling video
            feed), produce design specifications for the feature, then produce a
            design based on specifications from the write-up.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Interviewed dozens of UI designers, frontend engineers to determine
            their apptitude. I hand-screened hundreds of potential candidates’
            resumes &amp; portfolios before determining a cohort to move
            forward. Traits such as collaborative ability (focus on distributed
            teams as Dataing was remote); conceptual process &amp; strong
            principles in innovative thinking; design process &amp; tooling;
            decisiveness and previous level of project-ownership; and a style
            that aligned with our branding.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Hiring was a fun challenge. I feel the design landscape has changed
            since I graduated. I found the focus is placed heavily on research
            and process/execution, rather than raw design or technical skills.
            Most every candidate I spoke with was both a joy to get to know and
            a talented designer in their own right. I feel very positive about
            the talent pool, as well as my ability to recognize great hires
            after this experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Developed a suite of technical flow-chart elements</strong>
            to effectively communicate user flows, current development progress
            status, and future goals/sprints in a single visual graph format
            consumable by design, engineering, marketing, &amp; stakeholders
            alike. I wanted a way to bridge our increasing responsibilities and
            distributed tasks in an intuitive, easily digestible format for
            anyone on the team to enrich themselves.

          Collaborated with executive team to produce our pitch deck.
          <strong>Landed several key funding meetings</strong>. Many comments
          surrounded the
          <strong>engaging visuals &amp; message clarity</strong>. I developed a
          story for the deck: our company from <em>inception</em>, to
          <em>launch</em>, to <em>growth &amp; beyond</em>. Infusing a handful
          of styles from <strong>flat illustrations</strong> to
          <strong>modern material-based 3D fused with glassmorphism</strong> to
          delight the viewer and enhance the usual pitch deck experience. “<em

          <strong>Produced a 7-page Dataing Brand Book</strong>. Included color

          Marketing guidelines were designed to be as simple as possible to
          implement. I wanted a system that was hard to get wrong. I landed on a
          system with fractional spacing &amp; sizing. The less bullet points,
          the better.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Produced color palette, font, &amp; type presets</strong> for
          <em>Figma</em>, <em>Photoshop</em>, <em>Illustrator</em>, &amp;
          <em>Canva</em>. This to ensure our system was actually being used.

          Collaborated with marketing &amp; design teams to ensure brand

          throughout each post.

          <strong
            >Developed a primitive &amp; component-based architecture</strong
          >
          for our design system from scratch. Scalable &amp; totally flexible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Redefined the traditional token-based approach for a new
          <strong>primitives-based approach</strong> to enable a simpler, more
          intuitive way of inheritance for reusable design properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Defined hundreds of primitives in Figma</strong> across all
          token categories: color, sizing, spacing, effects, &amp; typography.
          Organized into separate libraries consumable by the design team.
          Libraries inherited other libraries to build a
          <strong>flexible &amp; scalable system</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Primitive libraries were used to build a collection of intermediate
          components, called modules, that lack any functionality. Modules group
          primitives into a layout. Think a profile photo container with a
          default icon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modules &amp; primitive libraries were used to build out the component
          suite. Components group together modules and primitives to include
          functionality and interactivity. Think a button that displays your
          profile photo and opens a dropdown when you tap it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Defined a rigid, yet expressive module structure–which extends to a
          rigid, yet expressive component structure. A completed component
          design structure will mirror the architecture of the component
          implementation in code–a 100% accurate representation of the component
          as a design, without sacrificing a designer’s flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          The design system was used in designing &amp; developing all
          components inside the production <em>Dataing</em> app.
