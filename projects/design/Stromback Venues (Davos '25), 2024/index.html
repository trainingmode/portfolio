      <pre><code>* November-December 2024
* After my initial meetings with the clients, one requirement emerged: “design for the uber-wealthy &amp; heads-of-state”.
* Stromback Venues provides venue leasing in Davos, Switzerland during the World Economic Forum.
* Decks were shown to business &amp; political leaders, including Elon Musk, BlackRock COO, and US government officials.
* Decks were used in closing 25m in leases for the week of WEF 2025.
* I was contracted to provide:
    * Initial concepts
    * Branding
    * Decks/presentation slides
    * Lay the groundwork &amp; systems for asset creation
    * Render high-quality graphics for print (shown on CNBC coverage)
* Clients came with a strong sense of how they wanted the customer to feel. My role was to interpret their vision—translating vibes into compelling concepts.
* Mature asset systems were handed off to a second team in Portugal to facilitate more rapid iterations, as they were in a closer time zone to Switzerland.
* This was a first-of-its-kind project for me, as I had never been contracted specifically for deck slides.
* I determined a simple goal: tell visual stories that excite viewers &amp; incentivize sustained engagement. This without sacrificing the most important aspect of a deck presentation: readability.
* Project length:
    * 5 weeks
* Materials produced:
    * 1 logo (multiple iterations); Figma
    * 1 wordmark (multiple iterations); Figma
    * 1 deck; Figma
    * 1 deck; Google Slides
    * 2 deck themes; Figma
    * 2 deck themes; Google Slides
    * 30 slides; Figma
    * 30 slides; Google Slides
    * 16 slide themes; Figma
    * 16 slide themes; Google Slides
    * 10 concept slide themes; Figma
    * 3 large-scale print-ready graphics; designed in Figma, made print-ready in Illustrator
* Tools used:
    * Figma
    * Google Slides
    * Adobe Illustrator (screen-print preparation)
    * Google Drive (team collaboration)
- [ ] Slides
    * I was solely responsible for producing the main event deck, presented to prospective customers.
    * A modern, refined, “ultra-premium” look was chosen to capture the emergence of generative AI across global markets.
    * Custom deck slides were designed in Figma.
    * Slide content was produced based on an outline document (bullet-points) provided by the clients. We worked together to develop a story that I would turn into visual assets.
    * Upon approval, the Figma designs were then fully recreated in Google Slides for presentation &amp; sharing.
    * Further themes for 2 additional decks were produced in Figma, recreated in Google Slides, then handed off to the team in Portugal.
    * Client strongly preferred matching the aesthetics of the venues for the remaining 2 themes—a speakeasy theme, and a patriotic USA theme.
- [ ] Graphics
    * Screen-printed window-graphics were produced for an exclusive venue attended by VIP US Government officials.
    * Large-scale print-ready graphics were designed in Figma.
    * Designs were drafted &amp; vectorized in Figma, then made print-ready in Illustrator.
    * Graphics were handed off for screen-printing near Davos.
- [ ] Branding
    * Branding elements, including a logo icon &amp; wordmark, were produced for an exclusive venue attended by VIP US Government officials.
    * Logo concepts were mocked in Figma.
    * Iterations and final render were produced in Figma.</code></pre>
