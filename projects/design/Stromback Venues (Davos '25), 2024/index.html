      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>November</strong> - <strong>December 2024</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        After my initial meetings with the clients, one requirement emerged:
        <em>design for the uber-wealthy &amp; heads-of-state</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Stromback Venues</strong> provides venue leasing in
        <strong>Davos, Switzerland</strong> during the
        <a href="https://www.weforum.org/">World Economic Forum</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decks were shown to business &amp; political leaders, including Elon
        Musk, BlackRock COO, and US government officials.
      </p>
      <p>Decks were used in closing 25m in leases for the week of WEF 2025.</p>
      <p>I was contracted to provide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Initial concepts</p></li>
        <li><p>Branding</p></li>
        <li><p>Decks/presentation slides</p></li>
        <li><p>Lay the groundwork &amp; systems for asset creation</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Render high-quality graphics for print (shown on
            <strong>CNBC</strong> coverage)
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Clients came with a strong sense of how they wanted the customer
              to feel. My role was to interpret their vision—translating vibes
              into compelling concepts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mature asset systems were handed off to a second team in Portugal
              to facilitate more rapid iterations, as they were in a closer time
              zone to Switzerland.
            </li>
            <li>
              This was a first-of-its-kind project for me, as I had never been
              contracted specifically for deck slides.
            </li>
            <li>
              I determined a simple goal: tell visual stories that excite
              viewers &amp; incentivize sustained engagement. This without
              sacrificing the most important aspect of a deck presentation:
              readability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Project length:
              <ul>
                <li>5 weeks</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Materials produced:
              <ul>
                <li>1 logo (multiple iterations); Figma</li>
                <li>1 wordmark (multiple iterations); Figma</li>
                <li>1 deck; Figma</li>
                <li>1 deck; Google Slides</li>
                <li>2 deck themes; Figma</li>
                <li>2 deck themes; Google Slides</li>
                <li>30 slides; Figma</li>
                <li>30 slides; Google Slides</li>
                <li>16 slide themes; Figma</li>
                <li>16 slide themes; Google Slides</li>
                <li>10 concept slide themes; Figma</li>
                <li>
                  3 large-scale print-ready graphics; designed in Figma, made
                  print-ready in Illustrator
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Tools used:
              <ul>
                <li>Figma</li>
                <li>Google Slides</li>
                <li>Adobe Illustrator (screen-print preparation)</li>
                <li>Google Drive (team collaboration)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <label><input type="checkbox" />Slides</label>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I was solely responsible for producing the main event deck,
                  presented to prospective customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A modern, refined, “ultra-premium” look was chosen to capture
                  the emergence of generative AI across global markets.
                </li>
                <li>Custom deck slides were designed in Figma.</li>
                <li>
                  Slide content was produced based on an outline document
                  (bullet-points) provided by the clients. We worked together to
                  develop a story that I would turn into visual assets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Upon approval, the Figma designs were then fully recreated in
                  Google Slides for presentation &amp; sharing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Further themes for 2 additional decks were produced in Figma,
                  recreated in Google Slides, then handed off to the team in
                  Portugal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Client strongly preferred matching the aesthetics of the
                  venues for the remaining 2 themes—a speakeasy theme, and a
                  patriotic USA theme.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Designs were drafted &amp; vectorized in Figma, then made
                  print-ready in Illustrator.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Graphics were handed off for screen-printing near Davos.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

              <label><input type="checkbox" />Branding</label>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Branding elements, including a logo icon &amp; wordmark, were
