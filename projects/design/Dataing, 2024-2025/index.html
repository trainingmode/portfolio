        <strong>Dataing</strong> is an AI matchmaking service, with a focus on
        dating. Connect your social media to let <em>Cupid AI</em>
        <strong>analyze your social media</strong> and
        <strong>match you</strong> with people you’ll find interesting.
      </p>
      <p>I <strong>cofounded the company</strong> with CEO Mark Kilaghbian.</p>
      <p>
        I both <strong>designed</strong> &amp; <strong>developed</strong> the
        initial <strong>webapp MVP</strong>; developed our
        <strong>v1 backend dashboard</strong>; developed our
        <strong>design system</strong>; developed the
        <strong>Waitlist webapp</strong>; spearheaded
        <strong>mobile design</strong> &amp;
        <strong>frontend development</strong>; and <strong>hired</strong>,
        <strong>trained</strong>, &amp; <strong>led</strong> intern designers
        &amp; engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I <strong>developed a Figma plugin</strong> for exporting designs as
        SwiftUI code—w<em>ithout AI translation</em>. A custom parser was built
        specifically for our design system. Much of the core SwiftUI standard is
        implemented. Designs are fully pixel &amp; layout accurate from Figma
        -&gt; SwiftUI.
      </p>
      <p>
        During 2024, I side-hustled upwards of 40-80 hours/week to afford to
        work on this project. This takes a toll on creative energy &amp; eats
        into creative time. I feel this project represents my perseverance and
        ability to stick through tough situations while performing my leadership
        &amp; creative duties accordingly.

      <p>
        My goal as a leader is to elevate my team, smartly delegate according to
        core competencies, provide immediate support, and remove friction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I develop &amp; implement systems so my team has a collective
        understanding of their individual responsibilities against our overall
        objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        My purpose is to maximize human capital efficiency &amp; maintain
        quality output.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Owned our Notion board, our knowledgebase hub. It contained
            onboarding for design &amp; marketing; guides (setup, maintenance)
            for various platforms (Figma, OpenAI, Azure, Google Cloud); and
            other resources. All fully-formatted, organized, &amp; beautiful.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            100% intern retention rate on $0 budget. All 7 design interns (UI
            &amp; marketing, 1 frontend) completed their full 6-month term, with
            several choosing to extend their internship. Intern attendance and
            alma-maters include USC, NYU, &amp; UCLA.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Delegated tasks &amp; ownership of key features. I believe fostering
            an environment of trust builds confidence amongst team members.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I made myself available 24/7–including weekends–to answer questions
            and support interns on their duties.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            I champion a culture of accountability, self-improvement, and
            innovative-thinking with hands-on mentorship.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Provided cross-discipline growth sessions that I tailored to
            individual intern paths. I enjoyed translating my skills &amp;
            knowledge in a way that complemented an interns current abilities. I
            wanted them to stay challenged &amp; confident, while continuing to
            grow during their time with us.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Developed case studies for interns: physical properties of light
            &amp; glass; gradient composition/blending &amp; color spaces;
            character design basics; Figma advanced techniques &amp; social
            content composition; “design-a-thon” weekend challenge to research
            an app’s major feature (aka TikTok’s scrolling video feed), produce
            design specifications for the feature, then produce a design based
            on specifications from the write-up.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Interviewed dozens of UI designers, frontend engineers to determine
            their apptitude. I hand-screened hundreds of potential candidates’
            resumes &amp; portfolios before determining a cohort to move
            forward. Traits such as collaborative ability (focus on distributed
            teams as Dataing was remote); conceptual process &amp; strong
            principles in innovative thinking; design process &amp; tooling;
            decisiveness and previous level of project-ownership; and a style
            that aligned with our branding.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Hiring was a fun challenge. I feel the design landscape has changed
            since I graduated. I found the focus is placed heavily on research
            and process/execution, rather than raw design or technical skills.
            Most every candidate I spoke with was both a joy to get to know and
            a talented designer in their own right. I feel very positive about
            the talent pool, as well as my ability to recognize great hires
            after this experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Developed a suite of technical flow-chart elements to effectively
            communicate user flows, current development progress status, and
            future goals/sprints in a single visual graph format consumable by
            design, engineering, marketing, &amp; stakeholders alike. I wanted a
            way to bridge our increasing responsibilities and distributed tasks
            in an intuitive, easily digestible format for anyone on the team to
            enrich themselves.

        </li>
        <li>
          Ran biweekly design meetings to align design team on objectives, offer
          guidance on tasks, and provide mentoring to aid in increasing our
          interns’ abilities overall.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spearheaded UX research, using phone screenshots &amp; Mobbin to
          document competition.
        </li>
        <li>
          Produced internal research documents detailing competitor features for
          the top-6 dating apps, with &amp; without advertised AI-features (at
          the time).
        </li>
        <li>
          Engaged students on-campus (UCLA, USC, UCSD) to gauge their dating app
          familiarity, experience dating in-real life, their goals in dating
          &amp; lifestyle, as well as their general requests to improve the
          dating scene.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coordinated language &amp; messaging with marketing team (Figma).
        </li>
        <li>
          Led initiatives to produce several fully-interactive Figma prototypes.
          Full-app prototypes to test flows, as well as single/multi-feature to
          test interactivity. Both solo &amp; team-produced prototypes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="marketing-design">Marketing Design</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Collaborated with executive team to produce our pitch deck. Landed
          several key funding meetings. Many comments surrounded the engaging
          visuals &amp; message clarity. I developed a story for the deck: our
          company from inception, to launch, to growth and beyond. Infusing a
          handful of styles from flat illustrations to modern material-based 3D
          fused with glassmorphism to delight the viewer and enhance the usual
          pitch deck experience. “I wanted to keep going just to see the next
          slide.”
        </li>
        <li>
          Produced 7-page Dataing Brand Book. Included color palette, fonts,
          type guidelines, usage rules, messaging &amp; tone, and
          examples/templates for digital content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Marketing guidelines were designed to be as simple as possible to
          implement. I wanted a system that was hard to get wrong. I landed on a
          system with fractional spacing &amp; sizing. The less bullet points,
          the better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Produced color palette, font, &amp; type presets for Figma, Photoshop,
          Illustrator, &amp; Canva. This to ensure our system was actually being
          used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborated with marketing &amp; design teams to ensure brand
          consistency across socials. Implemented a multi-party review system
          for ensuring our brand tone &amp; visual identity remained consistent
          throughout each post.
        </li>
        <li>
          Audited assets &amp; content for visual and messaging consistency,
          providing refinements to maintain brand integrity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="design-system">Design System</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a primitive &amp; component-based architecture for our
          design system from scratch. Scalable &amp; totally flexible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Redefined the traditional token-based approach for a new
          primitives-based approach to enable a simpler, more intuitive way of
          inheritance for reusable design properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Defined hundreds of primitives in Figma across all token categories:
          color, sizing, spacing, effects, &amp; typography. Organized into
          separate libraries consumable by the design team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Primitive libraries were used to build a collection of intermediate
          components, called modules, that lack any functionality. Modules group
          primitives into a layout. Think a profile photo container with a
          default icon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modules &amp; primitive libraries were used to build out the component
          suite. Components group together modules and primitives to include
          functionality and interactivity. Think a button that displays your
          profile photo and opens a dropdown when you tap it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Defined a rigid, yet expressive module structure–which extends to a
          rigid, yet expressive component structure. A completed component
          design structure will mirror the architecture of the component
          implementation in code–a 100% accurate representation of the component
          as a design, without sacrificing a designer’s flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          The design system was used in designing &amp; developing all
          components inside the production Dataing app.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fully automated the translation of our design system from Figma to
          code by developing our Figma2Swift generator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="figma2swift">Figma2Swift</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I built a Figma plugin that reads the Figma API tree and renders to a
          SwiftUI component structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Facilitates rapid, pixel-and-layout-perfect translations of our design
          system.
        </li>
        <li>
          The parser design is directly influenced by component structure
          defined in the design system.
