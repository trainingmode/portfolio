      <pre><code>* September 2023 - April 2025
* Launched: April 2025
* Dataing is an AI matchmaking service, with a focus on dating. Connect your social media to let Cupid AI analyze your social media and match you with people you’ll find interesting.
* I cofounded the company with CEO Mark Kilaghbian.
* I both designed &amp; developed the initial webapp MVP, developed our v1 backend dashboard, developed our design system, developed the Waitlist, spearheaded mobile design &amp; frontend development, and hired+trained+led intern designers &amp; engineers.
* I developed a Figma plugin for exporting designs as SwiftUI code—without AI translation. A custom parser was built specifically for our design system. Much of the core SwiftUI standard is implemented. Designs are fully pixel &amp; layout accurate from Figma -&gt; SwiftUI.
* During 2024, I side-hustled upwards of 40-80 hours/week to afford to work on this project. This takes a toll on creative energy &amp; eats into creative time. I feel this project represents my perseverance and ability to stick through tough situations while performing my leadership &amp; creative duties accordingly.
* These are one-half of my responsibilities at Dataing. For my engineering responsibilities, please see here.
* (Exclude) The cost of tech debt, lack of focus, and rushed decisions became difficult to manage. I flagged the signs, but it takes combined effort to overcome these issues. Ultimately, I realized the internal dynamics no longer aligned with my own values for product leadership.
* Key responsibilities:
    * Chief Product Officer
    * Head of Product
    * Head of Design
    * Idea-to-product
    * Directed UI design, iOS frontend, &amp; marketing design teams
    * Trained and led design interns
    * Mentored junior engineers
    * Designed the logo, wordmark, &amp; Cupid Bot (cartoon) character
    * Designed and implemented our design system
    * Designed marketing/branding assets
    * Built a Figma-to-SwiftUI export tooling (custom parser, non-AI)
    * Developed and shipped web MVP, Waitlist, Website, iOS beta
    * Shaped brand identity and visual direction
    * Created internal tools to accelerate design-engineering workflow
    * Created marketing, branding assets; pitch decks; character design
* Tools used:
    * VS Code
    * Figma
    * Sketch (initial mockups)
    * Adobe Suite
    * Notion
    * Jira (Dev+Design Teams)
    * Trello (Marketing Team)
    * Google Docs, Sheets
- [ ] Leadership &amp; Mentorship
    * My goal as a leader is to elevate my team, smartly delegate according to core competencies, provide immediate support, and remove friction. I develop &amp; implement systems so my team has a collective understanding of their individual responsibilities against our overall objectives. My purpose is to maximize human capital efficiency &amp; maintain quality output.
    * Owned our Notion board, our knowledgebase hub. It contained onboarding for design &amp; marketing; guides (setup, maintenance) for various platforms (Figma, OpenAI, Azure, Google Cloud); and other resources. All fully-formatted, organized, &amp; beautiful.
    * 100% intern retention rate on $0 budget. All 7 design interns (UI &amp; marketing, 1 frontend) completed their full 6-month term, with several choosing to extend their internship. Intern attendance and alma-maters include USC, NYU, &amp; UCLA.
    * Delegated tasks &amp; ownership of key features. I believe fostering an environment of trust builds confidence amongst team members.
    * I made myself available 24/7–including weekends–to answer questions and support interns on their duties.
    * I champion a culture of accountability, self-improvement, and innovative-thinking with hands-on mentorship.
    * Provided cross-discipline growth sessions that I tailored to individual intern paths. I enjoyed translating my skills &amp; knowledge in a way that complemented an interns current abilities. I wanted them to stay challenged &amp; confident, while continuing to grow during their time with us.
    * Developed case studies for interns: physical properties of light &amp; glass; gradient composition/blending &amp; color spaces; character design basics; Figma advanced techniques &amp; social content composition; “design-a-thon” weekend challenge to research an app’s major feature (aka TikTok’s scrolling video feed), produce design specifications for the feature, then produce a design based on specifications from the write-up.
    * Interviewed dozens of UI designers, frontend engineers to determine their apptitude. I hand-screened hundreds of potential candidates’ resumes &amp; portfolios before determining a cohort to move forward. Traits such as collaborative ability (focus on distributed teams as Dataing was remote); conceptual process &amp; strong principles in innovative thinking; design process &amp; tooling; decisiveness and previous level of project-ownership; and a style that aligned with our branding.
    * Hiring was a fun challenge. I feel the design landscape has changed since I graduated. I found the focus is placed heavily on research and process/execution, rather than raw design or technical skills. Most every candidate I spoke with was both a joy to get to know and a talented designer in their own right. I feel very positive about the talent pool, as well as my ability to recognize great hires after this experience.
    * Developed a suite of technical flow-chart elements to effectively communicate user flows, current development progress status, and future goals/sprints in a single visual graph format consumable by design, engineering, marketing, &amp; stakeholders alike. I wanted a way to bridge our increasing responsibilities and distributed tasks in an intuitive, easily digestible format for anyone on the team to enrich themselves.
- [ ] iOS App
    * Native SwiftUI frontend.
    * Grew the team to 2 UI design interns, 1 UX research/concept intern, 1 SwiftUI frontend intern.
    * Directed design team and collaborated with development team to realize the product vision.
    * Defined design tokens, abstracted key UI patterns into a highly reusable design system.
    * Presented product demos &amp; progress updates to stakeholders.
    * Organized cross-functional updates to align the entire team during weekly all-hands meetings.
    * Aligned the team around weekly sprint goals and product priorities using Jira.
    * Ran weekly meetings to align engineering and design teams. Spearheaded feature clarity and smooth handoffs.
    * Ran biweekly design meetings to align design team on objectives, offer guidance on tasks, and provide mentoring to aid in increasing our interns’ abilities overall.
    * Spearheaded UX research, using phone screenshots &amp; Mobbin to document competition.
    * Produced internal research documents detailing competitor features for the top-6 dating apps, with &amp; without advertised AI-features (at the time).
    * Engaged students on-campus (UCLA, USC, UCSD) to gauge their dating app familiarity, experience dating in-real life, their goals in dating &amp; lifestyle, as well as their general requests to improve the dating scene.
    * Coordinated language &amp; messaging with marketing team (Figma).
    * Led initiatives to produce several fully-interactive Figma prototypes. Full-app prototypes to test flows, as well as single/multi-feature to test interactivity. Both solo &amp; team-produced prototypes.
- [ ] Marketing Design
    * Collaborated with executive team to produce our pitch deck. Landed several key funding meetings. Many comments surrounded the engaging visuals &amp; message clarity. I developed a story for the deck: our company from inception, to launch, to growth and beyond. Infusing a handful of styles from flat illustrations to modern material-based 3D fused with glassmorphism to delight the viewer and enhance the usual pitch deck experience. “I wanted to keep going just to see the next slide.”
    * Produced 7-page Dataing Brand Book. Included color palette, fonts, type guidelines, usage rules, messaging &amp; tone, and examples/templates for digital content.
    * Marketing guidelines were designed to be as simple as possible to implement. I wanted a system that was hard to get wrong. I landed on a system with fractional spacing &amp; sizing. The less bullet points, the better.
    * Produced color palette, font, &amp; type presets for Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, &amp; Canva. This to ensure our system was actually being used.
    * Collaborated with marketing &amp; design teams to ensure brand consistency across socials. Implemented a multi-party review system for ensuring our brand tone &amp; visual identity remained consistent throughout each post.
    * Audited assets &amp; content for visual and messaging consistency, providing refinements to maintain brand integrity.
- [ ] Design System
    * Developed a primitive &amp; component-based architecture for our design system from scratch. Scalable &amp; totally flexible.
    * Redefined the traditional token-based approach for a new primitives-based approach to enable a simpler, more intuitive way of inheritance for reusable design properties.
    * Defined hundreds of primitives in Figma across all token categories: color, sizing, spacing, effects, &amp; typography. Organized into separate libraries consumable by the design team.
    * Primitive libraries were used to build a collection of intermediate components, called modules, that lack any functionality. Modules group primitives into a layout. Think a profile photo container with a default icon.
    * Modules &amp; primitive libraries were used to build out the component suite. Components group together modules and primitives to include functionality and interactivity. Think a button that displays your profile photo and opens a dropdown when you tap it.
    * Defined a rigid, yet expressive module structure–which extends to a rigid, yet expressive component structure. A completed component design structure will mirror the architecture of the component implementation in code–a 100% accurate representation of the component as a design, without sacrificing a designer’s flexibility.
    * The design system was used in designing &amp; developing all components inside the production Dataing app.
    * Fully automated the translation of our design system from Figma to code by developing our Figma2Swift generator.
- [ ] Figma2Swift
    * I built a Figma plugin that reads the Figma API tree and renders to a SwiftUI component structure.
    * Facilitates rapid, pixel-and-layout-perfect translations of our design system.
    * The parser design is directly influenced by component structure defined in the design system.
    * 100% of the initial app frontend was generated from our design system.
    * Components were generated inside Figma using the Figma2Swift plugin I developed–zero AI involved.
    * Implementation with our backend services took 3 days.
    * Components are fully reusable.
    * 100% pixel accuracy translating from Figma.
- [ ] MVP
    * 2 months idea-to-product
    * Designed &amp; developed front-end using React &amp; Tailwind.
    * There are no high-quality MVP design fragments; the MVP was designed and developed simultaneously.
    * OpenAI API, Azure Services hosted deployment, Vercel hosted frontend.
    * Sleek, native “Apple”-look &amp; feel.
    * Influences from glassmorphism.
    * When I design interfaces, I imagine elements in the physical-space, with material properties.
    * A glass surface with an LED-strip lining its outer borders. When you interact, the LEDs light-up.
    * Black-ink etched lettering on clear-coated acrylic.
    * A foggy pane of frosted glass.
    * Handwritten swipe-gestures for a native-feeling experience on mobile; swipe to delete threads, swipe the sidebar open/closed, swipe popup sheets closed, etc.
    * GPT-based AI chatbot w/ rooms/threads; fully-featured AI chatbot (regenerate message, edit previous messages, etc.); message streaming.
    * “Data cards” visually represent items Cupid AI has analyzed from your social media.
    * Mobile-first design; fully responsive; all features work across mobile &amp; desktop.
    * Custom react-spring animations.
- [ ] Waitlist
    * 3 weeks idea-to-product.
    * Check it out at beta.dataing.io. (Don’t mind the ominous, blue AI-generated character). You need to sign up to access the Waitlist product.
    * 500 signups 3 weeks post-launch.
    * Repurposed tech from MVP including Data cards, backend services, and visual styling.
    * Referral code generator; users can generate referral codes with custom URL links that they can share. Users can view the amount of signups created using their referral code.
    * Simple, single column app design.
    * Custom react-spring animations.
    * Coordinated language &amp; messaging of FAQ section with marketing team.
- [ ] Website
    * 2 days idea-to-product.
    * Check it out at dataing.io.
    * Quick-and-dirty landing page &amp; contact page.
    * Custom GLSL shader maps luminosity values to a color set &amp; a character set for an iridescent, binary “matrix”-effect. The shader is applied to a &lt;video&gt; element.
    * Custom react-spring animations.
    * Coordinated language &amp; messaging with marketing team.</code></pre>
