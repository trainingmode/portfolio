During Fall 2022, I was tasked with creating a series of graphics for a new product. The product was a **mobile app** that allowed users to **create & share** **cartoon stylized selfies**.

The client requested a series of graphics to be used on the app, including a **profile picture frame**, **social media post**, and **profile picture**.
