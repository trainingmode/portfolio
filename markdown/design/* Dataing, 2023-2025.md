**Dataing** is an AI matchmaking service, with a focus on dating. Connect your social media to let _Cupid AI_ **analyze your social media** and **match you** with people you’ll find interesting.

I **cofounded the company** with CEO Mark Kilaghbian.

I both **designed** & **developed** the initial **webapp MVP**; developed our **v1 backend dashboard**; developed our **design system**; developed the **Waitlist webapp**; spearheaded **mobile design** & **frontend development**; and **hired**, **trained**, & **led** intern designers & engineers.

I **organized & coordinated our team during the early stages of the company** and **led the design team through the development of the iOS app**. Using classic **Agile practices** and armed with a 4-tier Jira board (**To Do**, **In Progress**, **Review**, **Done**), I coordinated the engineering team's work and directed the design team's work. I also coordinated with the marketing team to ensure brand consistency across socials.

I **developed a Figma plugin** for exporting designs as SwiftUI code—w*ithout AI translation*. A **custom parser** was built specifically for our design system. Much of the core SwiftUI standard is implemented. Designs are fully pixel & layout accurate from Figma -> SwiftUI.

During 2024, I side-hustled upwards of 40-80 hours/week to afford to work on this project. This takes a toll on creative energy & eats into creative time. I feel this project represents my perseverance and ability to stick through tough situations while performing my leadership & creative duties accordingly.

## Leadership & Mentorship

My goal as a leader is to elevate my team, smartly delegate according to core competencies, provide immediate support, and remove friction.

I develop & implement systems so my team has a collective understanding of their individual responsibilities against our overall objectives.

My purpose is to maximize human capital efficiency & maintain quality output.

- **Owned our Figma**. Organization was crucial. I created systems for organizing components, tokens, and other design assets. Made marketing, UI assets exportable and easibly accessible org-wide. Categorized assets into separate libraries, design files, and folders for a more intuitive, organized experience.

- **Owned our Notion**, our knowledgebase hub. It contained onboarding for design & marketing; guides (setup, maintenance) for various platforms (_Figma_, _OpenAI_, _Azure_, _Google Cloud_); and other resources. All **fully-formatted**, **organized**, & **beautiful**.

- **_100% intern retention rate on $0 budget_**. All `7` design interns (UI & marketing, 1 frontend) completed their full 6-month term, with several choosing to extend their internship. Intern attendance and alma-maters include USC, NYU, & UCLA.

- Delegated tasks & ownership of key features. I believe fostering an environment of trust builds confidence amongst team members.

- I **made myself available 24/7**–**including weekends**–to answer questions and support interns on their duties.

- I champion a culture of _accountability_, _self-improvement_, and _innovative-thinking_ with **hands-on mentorship**.

- **Provided cross-discipline growth sessions** that I tailored to individual intern paths. I enjoyed translating my skills & knowledge in a way that complemented an interns current abilities. I wanted them to stay challenged & confident, while continuing to grow during their time with us.

- **Developed case studies** for interns: physical properties of light & glass; gradient composition/blending & color spaces; character design basics; Figma advanced techniques & social content composition; “design-a-thon” weekend challenge to research an app’s major feature (aka TikTok’s scrolling video feed), produce design specifications for the feature, then produce a design based on specifications from the write-up.

- Interviewed dozens of UI designers, frontend engineers to determine their apptitude. I hand-screened hundreds of potential candidates’ resumes & portfolios before determining a cohort to move forward. Traits such as collaborative ability (focus on distributed teams as Dataing was remote); conceptual process & strong principles in innovative thinking; design process & tooling; decisiveness and previous level of project-ownership; and a style that aligned with our branding.

- Hiring was a fun challenge. I feel the design landscape has changed since I graduated. I found the focus is placed heavily on research and process/execution, rather than raw design or technical skills. Most every candidate I spoke with was both a joy to get to know and a talented designer in their own right. I feel very positive about the talent pool, as well as my ability to recognize great hires after this experience.

- **Developed a suite of technical flow-chart elements** to effectively communicate user flows, current development progress status, and future goals/sprints in a single visual graph format consumable by design, engineering, marketing, & stakeholders alike. I wanted a way to bridge our increasing responsibilities and distributed tasks in an intuitive, easily digestible format for anyone on the team to enrich themselves.

## iOS App

- **Native SwiftUI frontend**.
- Grew the team to `2` UI design interns, `1` UX research/concept intern, `1` _SwiftUI_ frontend intern.
- **Directed design team** and collaborated with development team to realize the product vision.
- Defined design tokens, abstracted key UI patterns into a highly reusable design system.
- **Presented product demos** & **progress updates** to stakeholders. **Produced decks & media** for presentation.
- **Organized cross-functional updates** to align the entire team during weekly all-hands meetings.
- **Aligned the team** around weekly sprint goals and product priorities using _Jira_.
- **Ran weekly meetings** to align engineering and design teams. Spearheaded feature clarity and smooth handoffs.
- **Ran biweekly design meetings** to align design team on objectives, offer guidance on tasks, and provide mentoring to aid in increasing our interns’ abilities overall.
- **Spearheaded UX research**, using phone screenshots & _Mobbin_ to document competition.
- **Produced internal research documents** detailing competitor features for the top-6 dating apps, with & without advertised AI-features (at the time).
- **Engaged students on-campus** (_UCLA_, _USC_, _UCSD_) to gauge their dating app familiarity, experience dating in-real life, their goals in dating & lifestyle, as well as their general requests to improve the dating scene.
- **Coordinated language & messaging** with marketing team (_Figma_).
- **Led initiatives** to produce several fully-interactive _Figma_ prototypes. Full-app prototypes to test flows, as well as single/multi-feature to test interactivity. Both so**lo & team-produced prototypes**.

## Marketing Design

- Collaborated with executive team to produce our pitch deck. **Landed several key funding meetings**. Many comments surrounded the **engaging visuals & message clarity**. I developed a story for the deck: our company from _inception_, to _launch_, to _growth & beyond_. Infusing a handful of styles from **flat illustrations** to **modern material-based 3D fused with glassmorphism** to delight the viewer and enhance the usual pitch deck experience. “_I wanted to keep going just to see the next slide._”
- **Produced a 7-page Dataing Brand Book**. Included color palette, fonts, type guidelines, usage rules, messaging & tone, and examples/templates for digital content.
- Marketing guidelines were designed to be as simple as possible to implement. I wanted a system that was hard to get wrong. I landed on a system with fractional spacing & sizing. The less bullet points, the better.
- **Produced color palette, font, & type presets** for _Figma_, _Photoshop_, _Illustrator_, & _Canva_. This to ensure our system was actually being used.
- Collaborated with marketing & design teams to ensure brand consistency across socials. Implemented a multi-party review pipeline for ensuring our brand tone & visual identity remained consistent throughout each post.
- **Audited assets & content** for visual and messaging consistency, providing refinements to maintain brand integrity.

## Design System

- **Developed a primitive & component-based architecture** for our design system from scratch. Scalable & totally flexible.
- Redefined the traditional token-based approach for a new **primitives-based approach** to enable a simpler, more intuitive way of inheritance for reusable design properties.
- **Defined hundreds of primitives in Figma** across all token categories: color, sizing, spacing, effects, & typography. Organized into separate libraries consumable by the design team. Libraries inherited other libraries to build a **flexible & scalable system**.
- Primitive libraries were used to build a collection of intermediate components, called modules, that lack any functionality. Modules group primitives into a layout. Think a profile photo container with a default icon.
- Modules & primitive libraries were used to build out the component suite. Components group together modules and primitives to include functionality and interactivity. Think a button that displays your profile photo and opens a dropdown when you tap it.
- Defined a rigid, yet expressive module structure–which extends to a rigid, yet expressive component structure. A completed component design structure will mirror the architecture of the component implementation in code–a 100% accurate representation of the component as a design, without sacrificing a designer’s flexibility.
- The design system was used in designing & developing all components inside the production _Dataing_ app.
- **Fully automated the translation of our design system from Figma to code** by developing our [Figma2Swift](#figma2swift) generator.

## Figma2Swift

- I **built a _Figma_ plugin** that reads the _Figma_ API tree and renders to a _SwiftUI_ component structure.
- Facilitates rapid, **pixel-and-layout-perfect translations of our design system**.
- The parser design is directly influenced by component structure defined in the design system.
- **100% of the initial app frontend was generated from our design system**.
- Components were generated inside _Figma_ using the Figma2Swift plugin I developed–zero AI involved.
- Implementation with our backend services took `3` days.
- **Components are fully reusable**.
- **100% pixel accuracy** translating from _Figma_.
- **100% layout accuracy** translating from _Figma_. **_All SwiftUI stack types and alignments are fully supported_**.

## MVP
