# Stromback Venues/World Economic Forum Davos 2025

> **November** - **December 2024**

After my initial meetings with the clients, one requirement emerged: _design for the uber-wealthy & heads-of-state_.

**Stromback Venues** provides venue leasing in **Davos, Switzerland** during the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/).

Decks were shown to business & political leaders, including Elon Musk, BlackRock COO, and US government officials.

Decks were used in closing 25m in leases for the week of WEF 2025.

I was contracted to provide:

- Initial concepts
- Branding
- Decks/presentation slides
- Lay the groundwork & systems for asset creation
- Render high-quality graphics for print (shown on **CNBC** coverage)

  - Clients came with a strong sense of how they wanted the customer to feel. My role was to interpret their vision—translating vibes into compelling concepts.
  - Mature asset systems were handed off to a second team in Portugal to facilitate more rapid iterations, as they were in a closer time zone to Switzerland.
  - This was a first-of-its-kind project for me, as I had never been contracted specifically for deck slides.
  - I determined a simple goal: tell visual stories that excite viewers & incentivize sustained engagement. This without sacrificing the most important aspect of a deck presentation: readability.
  - Project length:
    - 5 weeks
  - Materials produced:
    - 1 logo (multiple iterations); Figma
    - 1 wordmark (multiple iterations); Figma

  * [ ] Slides
    - I was solely responsible for producing the main event deck, presented to prospective customers.
    - A modern, refined, “ultra-premium” look was chosen to capture the emergence of generative AI across global markets.
    - Custom deck slides were designed in Figma.
    - Slide content was produced based on an outline document (bullet-points) provided by the clients. We worked together to develop a story that I would turn into visual assets.
    - Upon approval, the Figma designs were then fully recreated in Google Slides for presentation & sharing.
    - Further themes for 2 additional decks were produced in Figma, recreated in Google Slides, then handed off to the team in Portugal.
    - Client strongly preferred matching the aesthetics of the venues for the remaining 2 themes—a speakeasy theme, and a patriotic USA theme.
