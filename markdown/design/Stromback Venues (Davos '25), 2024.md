After my initial meetings with the clients, one requirement emerged: _design for the uber-wealthy & heads-of-state_.

**Stromback Venues** provides venue leasing in **Davos, Switzerland** during the [World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/).

Decks were shown to business & political leaders, including **Elon Musk**, **BlackRock COO**, and **US government officials**.

Decks were used in closing _**`25m`** **in leases**_ for the week of [WEF 2025](https://www.stromback.com/davos).

I was contracted to provide:

- **Initial concepts**
- **Branding**
- **Decks/presentation slides**
- **Lay the groundwork & systems for asset creation**
- **Render high-quality graphics for print/display** (_shown on **CNBC** coverage_)

Clients came with a strong sense of how they wanted the customer to feel. My role was to interpret their visionâ€”translating vibes into compelling concepts.

Mature asset systems were handed off to a second team in Portugal to facilitate more rapid iterations, as they were in a closer time zone to Switzerland.

This was a first-of-its-kind project for me, as I had never been contracted specifically for _deck slides_.

I determined a simple goal: tell visual stories that excite viewers & incentivize sustained engagement. This without sacrificing the most important aspect of a deck presentation: _readability_.

## Slides

I was solely responsible for producing the main event deck, presented to prospective customers.

A modern, refined, "_ultra-premium_" look was chosen to capture the emergence of generative AI across global markets.

- Custom **deck slides** were designed in _Figma_.
- Slide content was produced based on an outline document (bullet-points) provided by the clients.
- Clients and I worked together to **develop a story** that I would turn into visual assets.
- Upon approval, the _Figma_ designs were then **fully recreated in Google Slides** for presentation & sharing.
- Further themes for **`2`** **additional decks** were produced in _Figma_, recreated in _Google Slides_, then handed off to the team in Portugal.
- Client strongly preferred matching the aesthetics of the venues for the remaining **`2`** themesâ€”a **speakeasy theme**, and a **patriotic USA theme**. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

## Graphics

- **Screen-printed window-graphics** were produced for an exclusive venue attended by VIP US Government officials.
- Large-scale print-ready graphics were designed in _Figma_.
- Designs were drafted & vectorized in _Figma_, then **made print-ready** in _Adobe Illustrator_.
- Graphics were **handed off for screen-printing** near Davos, Switzerland.

## Branding

- Branding elements, including a **logo icon** & **wordmark**, were produced for an _exclusive venue_ attended by VIP US Government officials.
- Drawing on the clients' existing assets and the theme of the event, I drafted designs in the style of **American high-end luxury brands**.

- Logo concepts were mocked in _Figma_.
- Iterations and final render were produced in _Figma_.
