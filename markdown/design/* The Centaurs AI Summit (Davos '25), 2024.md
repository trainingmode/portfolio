[Ollivier Oullier](https://www.weforum.org/people/olivier-oullier/), PHD (founder/CEO of [Inclusive Brains](https://www.allianz-trade.com/en_global/news-insights/news/prometheus.html)) is a neuroscientist, AI entrepreneur and investor. He was hosting a multi-speaker summit through his organization, [The Centaurs](https://thecentaurs.ai/ "The Centaurs AI SUMMIT – Davos 2025 Edition"), on day 1 of the [World Economic Forum in Davos](https://www.weforum.org/ "The World Economic Forum"). Their new podcast, [The Centaurs AI](https://www.instagram.com/thecentaursai/ "The Centaurs AI Summit & Podcast Instagram"), launched during the summit.

I provided the **pitch deck** & **event schedules**. These materials were sent to attendees prior to the event and were used during the summit.

I was contracted to provide:

- **Initial concepts**
- **Branding**
- **Decks/presentation slides**
- **Scheduling posters/flyers**
- **Lay the groundwork & systems for asset creation**
- **Render high-quality graphics for display** (_shown on **CNBC** coverage_)

> _This project can be seen as an extension of my work with [Stromback Venues](</projects/design/Stromback%20Venues%20(Davos%20'25),%202024/> "Stromback Venues (Davos '25), 2024")._

For this project, the clients wanted a _hyper-modern_, _forward-thinking_ aesthetic. _Luxury = refinement_.

**Simplicity** & **bold contrast** were heavily employed to offer stark and captivating visuals for viewers, with a sense of _futuristic mystic_.

I continued my goal from past deck commissions: **tell visual stories while maximizing readability**.

Completed materials were sent to a team in Portugal for further asset creation; ranging from videos, social content, & a website.

#### Project length:

**`2 weeks`**

#### Materials produced:

- **`1`** **deck**; _Figma_
- **`1`** **deck**; _Google Slides_
- **`9`** **slides**; _Figma_
- **`9`** **slides**; _Google Slides_
- **`17`** **high-quality display graphics**; _Figma_

## Slides

I produced the **main event deck** & **scheduling** given to attendees.

An adventurous, bold look was chosen to capture the new frontiers provided by emerging AI technologies.

Focus was placed on capturing a striking elegance, rather than an over-the-top presence. A black base, with periwinkle accents & deep-violet undertones evoked a sense of adventure & mystery.

- Custom **deck slides** were designed in _Figma_.
- Slide content was produced based on an outline document (bullet-points) provided by the clients.
- Upon approval, the _Figma_ designs were then **fully recreated in Google Slides** for presentation & sharing.
- **Scheduling was produced** based on a similar outline document provided by clients.
- **Slides were prepared** in _Figma_ and sent to the team in Portugal for further asset creation.

## Branding
