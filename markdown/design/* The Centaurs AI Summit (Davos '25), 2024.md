[Ollivier Oullier](https://www.weforum.org/people/olivier-oullier/ "Ollivier Oullier | World Economic Forum"), PHD (founder/CEO of [Inclusive Brains](https://www.allianz-trade.com/en_global/news-insights/news/prometheus.html "Allianz Trade x Inclusive Brains")) is a neuroscientist, AI entrepreneur and investor. He was hosting a multi-speaker summit through his organization, [The Centaurs](https://thecentaurs.ai/ "The Centaurs AI SUMMIT â€“ Davos 2025 Edition"), on day 1 of the [World Economic Forum in Davos](https://www.weforum.org/ "The World Economic Forum"). Their new podcast, [The Centaurs AI Podcast](https://www.instagram.com/thecentaursai/ "The Centaurs AI Summit & Podcast Instagram"), launched during the summit.

I provided the **pitch deck** & **event schedules**. These materials were sent to attendees prior to the event and were used during the summit.

I was contracted to provide:

- **Initial concepts**
- **Branding**
- **Decks/presentation slides**
- **Scheduling posters/flyers**
- **Lay the groundwork & systems for asset creation**
- **Render high-quality graphics for display** (_shown on **CNBC** coverage_)

> _This project can be seen as an extension of my work with [Stromback Venues](</portfolio/design/Stromback Venues (Davos '25), 2024/> "Stromback Venues (Davos '25), 2024 | Alfred R. Duarte | Portfolio")._

For this project, the clients wanted a _hyper-modern_, _forward-thinking_ aesthetic. _Luxury = refinement_.

**Simplicity** & **bold contrast** were heavily employed to offer stark and captivating visuals for viewers, with a sense of _futuristic mystique_.

I continued my goal from past deck commissions: **tell visual stories while maximizing readability**.

Completed materials were sent to a team in Portugal for further asset creation; ranging from videos, social content, & a website.

## Motif

We've all been there: you design a strong motif with simple-enough patterns, send off guidelines & mockups to your client's team, and they return with... well, something else entirely.

This project was incredibly fast-paced, involved multiple stakeholders' input, was under a tight deadlineâ€“and the client's team was based in Portugal while I was based in Los Angeles.

I wanted to create a motif that could _truly_ be **easily adapted to different contexts**, ensuring cohesion under these extreme constraints.

![_The Centaurs AI Summit Motif & Breakdown, **2024** & **2025**_](/public/photos/stromback/ai-summit-motif-2025.png "The Centaurs AI Summit Motif, Alfred R. Duarte, 2024 & 2025")

An adventurous, bold look was chosen to capture the new frontiers provided by emerging AI technologies.

Focus was placed on capturing a striking elegance, rather than an over-the-top presence.

A **black base**, with **periwinkle accents** & **deep-violet undertones** evoked a sense of _adventure_ & _mystery_.

This motif was carried through the deck and all other assets produced for this project.

## Slides

I produced the **main event deck** & **scheduling** given to attendees.

- Custom **deck slides** were designed in _Figma_.
- Slide content was produced based on an outline document (bullet-points) provided by the clients.
- Upon approval, the _Figma_ designs were then **fully recreated in Google Slides** for presentation & sharing.
- **Scheduling was produced** based on a similar outline document provided by clients.
- **Slides were prepared** in _Figma_ and sent to the team in Portugal for further asset creation.

## Branding

![_The Centaurs AI Logo Icon, **2024**_](/public/photos/stromback/centaur-ai.png "The Centaurs AI Logo Icon, Alfred R. Duarte 2024")

- Branding elements, including a **logo icon** & **wordmark**, were produced for the event & podcast.
- Drawing on the clients' existing assets and concept of the Centaur, introduced by Chess legend Gary Kasparovâ€“revolving around the synergy of human and artificial intelligence.
- **Full concept boards** were produced in _Figma_.
- **Logo concepts** were mocked in _Figma_.
- Iterations and **final renders** were produced in _Figma_.

## Graphics

- **High-quality display graphics** were produced for the event.
- Display backgrounds, name cards, and title cards were produced.
- Style matched the event aesthetic I created for the deck & branding.
- **Concepts & final renders** were produced in _Figma_.
- Graphics were **handed off for additional asset creation** to a team in Portugal.
