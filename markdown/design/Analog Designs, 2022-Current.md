## Branding

I usually begin with simplicity. Crafting a logo from simple curves/shapes means anyone can draw it–and it's memorable.

I started with a very simple logo based on the concept of **stereophony** in audio recording.

The placement of your mics affect the amplitude & timing–the **phase** of the recorded wave–which produces a **stereo** effect.

If a bird chirps to your left, the distance traveled by the chirp to your right ear is greater than to your left. This creates a **phase difference**, which you perceive as a small delay on your right ear.

![_Bird Chirp Phase Difference, **2025**_](/public/photos/misc/bird-chirp-phase-difference.png "Bird Chirp Phase Difference, Alfred R. Duarte 2025")

I set up my mics and built out some logo concepts, keeping lines uncomplicated.

![_Analog Designs Logo Concept Ⅰ, **2022**_](/public/photos/analog-designs/analog-designs-logo-concept-i.png "Analog Designs Concept Ⅰ, Alfred R. Duarte 2022")

But it felt uninspired & incomplete. I wanted to craft a logo **bold** & **mesmerizing**.

I landed on the concept of the **interval of a sound wave**.

Rather than fluid audio curves, I imagined acoustic pressure waves (moreso amplitude) like sonar.

![_Sonar Principle, **Georg Wiora (Dr. Schorsch) 2008, CC BY-SA 3.0, [via Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sonar_Principle_EN.svg "File:Sonar Principle EN.svg – Wikimedia Commons")**_](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Sonar_Principle_EN.svg "Sonar Principle, Georg Wiora (Dr. Schorsch) 2008, Wikimedia Commons")

Using these principles, I designed the **logo icon** motif.

![_Analog Designs Stacked Logo Iterations, **2022**_](/public/photos/analog-designs/analog-designs-stacked-logo-iterations.png "Analog Designs Stacked Logo Iterations, Alfred R. Duarte 2022")

- I produced all branding elements, including the **logo icon** & **wordmark**.
- Produced **brand guidelines** for the company.
- Developed **color palette**, **fonts**, & **type presets** for the company.
- Designed logo based around the concept of **sound wave intervals**.
- Full concept boards were produced in _Sketch_.
- Logo concepts were mocked in _Sketch_.
- Iterations and final renders were produced in _Sketch_.

## Design System

I've written a [companion article](/portfolio/design/case-study-ui-styles-i-2022/ "Case Study: UI Styles I, 2022 | Alfred R. Duarte") with a detailed breakdown on the **design system** I developed.

## UI Engine

For more on the **OpenGL 2.1** (not ES2.1–_the 19 year old 2.1_) **graphics pipeline framework**, **graphics engine**, & **UI framework** I developed, please see [this article](/portfolio/engineering/under-construction/ "UNDER CONSTRUCTION | Alfred R. Duarte").

## Diode

![_Analog Designs Diode Promo – Sketch, **2022**_](/public/photos/analog-designs/analog-designs-diode-promo.png "Analog Designs Diode Promo – Sketch, Alfred R. Duarte 2022")

- `3` months idea-to-product
- **Designed** using _Sketch_.
- **Developed in custom UI framework**.
- **Implemented custom analog modeling DSP pipelines**.
- **Designed transistor-level circuit components** in _SPICE_.
- **Implemented circuit components** in _Faust_, translated to _custom DSP_.
- **Transistor**; **clipping network**; **biasing**; **RC filters**.
- Implemented **custom DSP pipeline as a VST 3 plugin**.
- **Collaborated with industry producers & engineers** to refine product.

## Website

Part of **Diode**'s marketing pitch is having control over its internal circuit components.

I wanted to play on that using the feeling of _blueprint_ & _wireframe sketches_.

![_Analog Designs Diode Website Mockup – Sketch, **2022**_](/public/photos/analog-designs/analog-designs-diode-site.png "Analog Designs Diode Website Mockup – Sketch, Alfred R. Duarte 2022")

- `2` weeks idea-to-product.
- Check it out at [analogdesigns.io](https://analogdesigns.io/ "Analog Designs | Modern Analog Modeling").
- **Landing page**, **contact**, & **terms pages**.
- Mockups were produced in _Sketch_.
- Final renders were **translated to and developed in** _React_ & _Tailwind_.
- Custom _react-parallax_ animations.

_This project was ultimately paused due to a shortage in personal funds._
