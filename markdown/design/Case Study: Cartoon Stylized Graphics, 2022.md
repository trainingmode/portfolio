During _Fall 2022_, I was tasked with **mocking up a series of character designs** for a children's sticker subscription box.

The client wanted a **cartoon-stylized look**, with fun, friendly characters. They asked for an "animation" style that "popped".

After completing the project, I wanted to document my learnings & process.

I produced a sprawling `20in` x `200in` poster detailing techniques ranging from **tooling** to **shading**, geared towards replicating the style in vector tools like **Affinity Designer**.

I've split the poster into **`4`** sections to make it easier to include in this article.

The techniques discussed are **generalized** and based on **physical principles** (even though these are cartoons). Most techniques can be easily adapted to other styles.

#### Tools used:
