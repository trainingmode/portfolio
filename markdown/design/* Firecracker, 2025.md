# Firecracker ‚Äî On-Chain Credit Cards

> **May 2025**

1. [**Research & Discovery**](#research-discovery)
2. [**v1: The Problem with "Features First"**](#v1-the-problem-with-features-first)
3. [**v2: Crypto-First Pivot**](#v2-crypto-first-pivot)
4. [**v3: Decentralization as Hero**](#v3-decentralization-as-hero)
5. [**The Winning Formula**](#the-winning-formula)

The workflows **AI agents** offer allow _near instant_ iteration on ideas, market research, and product development.

In this light case study, I explore how **agentic design** could be applied to product. It blends highly emergent technologies with traditional product thinking.

An up‚Äìand‚Äìcoming fintech company is launching a unique crypto product:

### [üß® ***Firecracker***]{.highlight} _on-chain credit cards._

We'll use **AI agents** to explore the product space, and iterate on the product.

#### Project length:

**`11 hours`**

#### Tools used:

- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/) (Research & Discovery)
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/) (Research & Product Development)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Hueshift](/portfolio/design/hueshift-2023/ "Hueshift | Alfred R. Duarte | Portfolio") (Color Palettes)

# Research & Discovery

[DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/ "DeepSeek ‚Äì Into the Unknown") was used to analyze opportunity areas, and guide our path to **product‚Äìmarket fit**.

[Claude](https://claude.ai/ "Claude") was used to substantiate findings and technical feasibility.

Additional research was conducted to understand how **sBTC** unlocks Bitcoin-backed credit without custody risks.

### Competitor gaps

Existing crypto cards (like [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/us/cards "Crypto.com Visa Card: The only card you need"), [BitPay](https://www.bitpay.com/card "Crypto Debit Card by BitPay | Turn Bitcoin Into Dollars Fast. Get Cash Back.")) rely on custodial models, and fiat transactions with crypto-incentives.

This misses the DeFi-native user, who wants to ***pay in BTC & settle in BTC***.

### User pain points

Nearly **`1`** in **`5`** cryptocurrency owners have had difficulty accessing or withdrawing crypto funds from custodial platforms.[^1]

Custodial platforms force users to lock their crypto in a centralized system, and ask for permission to spend it.

### Technical feasibility

**sBTC**‚Äôs trustless peg allows automated collateralization without centralized issuers (like banks).

You put **BTC** in, and get a loan amount‚Äîno asking, instant approval.

> [**Key insight:**]{.highlight} **_Decentralization_ was the unmet need, not just "crypto rewards."**

## _Learn a lil' crypto corner_ üí≥

When you use a traditional credit card, the bank is the middleman. They are the custodian of your money‚Äîthey decide when you can use it, and how much you can spend.

Decentralization is about removing the middleman.

[sBTC](https://stacks-network.github.io/stacks/sbtc.html "sBTC: Design of a Trustless Two-way Peg for Bitcoin") enables you to transfer Bitcoin into smart contracts using [**Stacks' Layer 2** (L2) protocol](https://www.stacks.co/learn/introduction "Stacks 101 - Learn about Stacks and why Bitcoin"). You lock your **BTC** into **sBTC**, allowing you to interact with **dApps** that can _instantly_ process your transactions against programmable conditions (like an NFT).

An **on-chain credit card company** could setup a contract to issue lending against your **sBTC**.

1. You lock your **BTC** into **sBTC**.
2. You deposit your **sBTC** into the credit card company's smart contract.
3. The company mints a credit card NFT for you‚Äîno custody, zero permissions.
4. You spend on your collateralized **BTC**.

You can even toss your **sBTC** into a _decentralized_ liquidity pool to earn interest. Other borrowers can borrow against the pool, and you earn interest on the collateral you supplied.

Zero custodial risk, backed by 100% Bitcoin finality.[^2]

# v1: The Problem with "Features First"

### [[**Visit the v1 Site ‚ûî**]{.highlight}](https://fintech-ghost-1.vercel.app/)

### Conversion Killer ü•∂

**Generic fintech language** ("seamless," "global access") failed to stand out in the crypto space.

**Multi-step signup process** added friction and discouraged users from completing the conversion.

### Missed Opportunity üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

Value proposition buried below fold under a generic card design.

> [**Key Insight:**]{.highlight} **Crypto users need immediate proof of decentralization.**

# v2: Crypto-First Pivot

### [[**Visit the v2 Site ‚ûî**]{.highlight}](https://fintech-ghost-2.vercel.app/)

### What Worked ü§î

"**‚Ä¶on-chain credit**" hero text speaks _directly_ to Web3 users.

Added **social proof** ("thousands of early adopters").

More attractive animated card mockup creates desire.

### New Problem üòµ‚Äçüí´

Overwhelming **information density** (6 features + metrics).

> [**Key insight:**]{.highlight} **Crypto credit users need to _instantly_ understand the value proposition.**

@[110%](https://fintech-ghost-2.vercel.app/)

# v3: Decentralization as Hero

### [[**Visit the Finalized Site ‚ûî**]{.highlight}](https://fintech-ghost-3.vercel.app/)

### Breakthrough Changes üòé

"**Fully decentralized credit card**" above fold instantly communicates _differentiation_.

Card-as-NFT implied through expiration date (**04/28 ‚âÖ Bitcoin halving year**[^3]).

DeFi integration as a **primary feature** (not just "rewards").

### Path to PMF üèéÔ∏è

**Monetize decentralization by packaging it as exclusive next‚Äìgen access.**

> [**Key insight:**]{.highlight} **Crypto users value sovereignty above all other features/metrics.**

@[110%](https://fintech-ghost-3.vercel.app/)

# The Winning Formula üéØ

### [Decentralization Promise (`v2`/`v3`) + Desire (`v2`) + Urgency (`v3`)]{.highlight}

## Why This Works for Crypto Audiences

### **Trust Through Transparency** ü§ù

[**v3's "secured by you"**]{.highlight} > **`v1's "complete ownership"`**

(_passive_ vs _active_)

### **Scarcity Engineering** üëÄ

No explicit waitlist number creates **artificial scarcity** (vs v2's "thousands")

### **Technical Credibility** üîê

"Cryptographically secured on-chain" satisfies advanced users without alienating beginners.

Language meets users where they are, highlighting the unique value proposition, without leaning on technical jargon.

## Conclusions üí≠

Crypto users prioritize _ownership over convenience_.

A path to **PMF**:

- Monetize decentralization by making it aspirational;
- Make the product experience feel unique and exclusive;
- And make the product feel secure and trustworthy.

In crypto, trust is currency.

***Amplify trust, simplify the experience.***
