My portfolio site is built with a custom static site generator.

Markdown **articles** & folder **directories** are rendered into **HTML** templates.

I needed a simple system to write articles and generate a site that was effortless to maintain. My core focus was writing articles and designing a site that was **100%** accessible.

What I've learned from previous projects is to reduce or avoid complexity. I would have just written pure HTML, but that makes for a horrible experience writing articles.

There is only **_`1`_** line of inline JavaScript on this site. It's on the home page CTA, needed to copy my email to your clipboard and close the context menu:

```javascript
onclick =
  "navigator.clipboard.writeText('alfred.r.duarte@gmail.com');document.activeElement.blur()";
```

Everything else is just CSS & Tailwind.

- [Bash 5](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html)
- [Vercel serve](https://github.com/vercel/serve) (dev server)

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/)

# Overview

Built on the **`Directory`** ‚Üí **`Article`** folder structure concept. Similar to other Static Site Generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll ‚Ä¢ Simple, blog-aware, static sites | Transform your plain text into static websites and blogs") or [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ "The Best React-Based Framework | Gatsby").

For this project, I mixed **pure HTML** with **Tailwind CSS** (via CDN) for the template system. Generated sites are extremely lightweight, with only the Tailwind CDN dependency.

Internally, **articles** are converted using **Pandoc**. While **Markdown** is preferred, Pandoc will [convert all files to HTML by default](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#specifying-formats "Specifying formats ‚Äì Pandoc ‚Äì Pandoc User‚Äôs Guide"). You could write articles in any markup format that **Pandoc** supports.

I wrote a set of internal **plugins** to preprocess special Markdown syntax, like **embedded iFrames** and **image comparisons**.

# Workflow

The **static site generator** is a set of bash scripts.

I had a neatly organized folder of Markdown articles.

I had an accompanying folder of HTML templates‚Äìorganized in an indentical structure‚Äìthat I wanted .
