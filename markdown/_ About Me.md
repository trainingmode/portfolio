### [**👋🏼 Nice to meet you!**]{.highlight}

I'm **Alfred**.

I specialize in driving innovative product development.

---

I’m a **Creative Technologist** and **Product Designer** with **10+ years** experience at the intersection of design, engineering, and systems thinking. My work spans real-time interfaces, AI-driven platforms, internal design systems, & developer tooling. All often delivered under tight constraints, with lean resources, & high impact.

My adaptability is always in service of those around me.

Most recently, I **led product at Dataing**, an AI matchmaking startup, managing cross-functional teams across web, iOS, and design systems. Alongside that, I’ve **operated my own studio**, delivering creative and technical solutions for clients in music, fashion, real estate, luxury, and tech.

I’m currently **producing an independent course** on creative coding and systems design. It bridges backend fundamentals with modern patterns like agentic debugging and emergent behavior. It’s built to share what I’ve learned creating real-world tools in complex environments.

---

I care about clarity, craft, mentorship, and shipping products that feel good to use, whether that’s in a leadership role or in the trenches with the team.

Good design is equal parts artistry & usability.
