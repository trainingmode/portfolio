I’m a **Creative Technologist** and **Product Designer** with **11+ years** experience at the intersection of design, engineering, and systems thinking. My work is cross-functional, and often delivered under tight constraints, with lean resources, & high impact.

My adaptability is always in service of those around me. You put me on the starting team, and I'll set up the rest of the organization for success.

Most recently, I **led product at Dataing**, an AI matchmaking startup, managing cross-functional teams across web, iOS, and design systems.

Alongside that, I’ve **operated my own studio**, delivering creative & technical solutions for clients in music, fashion, real estate, luxury, and tech.

I care about clarity, craft, mentorship, and shipping products that feel good to use, whether that’s in a leadership role or in the trenches with the team.
